# SpreadOfContamination
Graduate Project developed while working as a RA

Here a three-dimensional model is generated for interior environment using point cloud data points collected from a depth camera; analyzed along with skeleton data to determine the precise orientation of the head and position of the nose. This data is then used with fluid dynamics to identify the area that could be polluted by a person with an airborne disease and to forecast the spread of the disease to other people in a closed setting.

I have used "Orbbec Femto" time of flight camera for this project.

Create a folder "/external" in the root directory of your project.
